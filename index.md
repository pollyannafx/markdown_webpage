# Landing {.unnumbered}

## hey, i'm me. 
I'm an undergraduate student of data science and anthropology based in the United States, and my ambition is social epidemiology, though I am still exploring opportunities in service-oriented, data-driven research.

## about the website 
I wanted to create a personal, anonymous space for could pursue coding projects not directly relevant to my academic career; sometimes, goofy ideas that absolutely *need* to be brought to light enter my brain and refuse to leave. Not all code here follows best practises, especially on older projects; that is deliberate, as I wish to track my learning journey.

Some of my projects are shared with friends on the Internet, hence my anonymity. I also consider my personal GitHub a repository for creative—not technical—work, so my identity here is kept somewhat separate from the more sanitised persona I bring to academic settings.
